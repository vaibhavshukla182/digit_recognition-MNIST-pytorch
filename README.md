#MNIST

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

#PyTorch
this code is using pytorch,the newly released deep learning framework to build a simple CNN to tackle the classic problem,MNIST.
During this process,I've learned how to build a simple network with pytorch.

I have used two Convolutional Layers with two fully connected layer.
